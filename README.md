##DESCRIPTION
POP Listings is a simple PHP script for managing your joined fanlistings, or any list of links.
You can import basic categories used on theFanlistings website, or add your own categories. It’s simple to add a listing, image upload is fully integrated. You can convert all the images you upload in the same chosen format or let them to their original format.
The script is still in progress and you can see below what is already working.
